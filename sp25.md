## Introduction

In this course, we will explore applications of computer programming in design, focusing on how coding can be used to modify our design tools and create custom workflows that embed greater intelligence into our design processes.

Writing code, or "programming" is the oldest way of working with a computer, and was indeed the only way until the emergence of modern graphical user interfaces (GUI's) around the 1980's. While most people today interact with some kind of computer on a daily basis, GUI's allow them to interact with the software without even being aware of the code that actually tells the computer what to do. This way of interacting with computers makes software much easier to learn and work with, but also makes that software constrained to specific functionality that must be universal to all users. It also results in a lot of manual work from the user to get the software to do what they need it to do.

Writing our own code enables us to create our own tools that solve our specific needs, thereby embedding more intelligence into our process. As a side product such workflows tend to automate the most repetitive and routine design tasks so you can focus less on the technical work and more on the creative part of design. While computer software is now integrated into almost every design practice, actually writing computer code or creating custom software is not a typical skill set for a designer. While learning this new skill can be daunting, even learning a little bit will allow you to start customizing your tools and save you time.

The good news is we don't have to start from scratch, and you don't necessarily need to be able to build your own CAD software like Revit or Rhino to start developing custom tools and workflows. Most CAD software today support developing custom features and extensions through plugins and scripting interfaces. This allows you to get started with just a few lines of code, and expand the capabilities of your tools as your knowledge of coding grows.

This course is structured around several hands-on exercises that will demonstrate a variety of computational approaches and strategies for solving design problems through code. The class will focus on building real applications, while covering enough theory and case studies to ground the work we will be doing and expose some of the larger possibilities.

## Tech stack

The class will use several tools:

- **[Rhino3d](https://www.rhino3d.com/)** - great all-purpose 3d modeling software with great support for developing custom extensions through code
- **[Grasshopper](https://www.grasshopper3d.com/)** - Rhino's visual programming environment which gives us programmatic access to Rhino's geometry library and allows us to create automations by linking together visual building blocks representing different geometric commands
- **[Python](https://www.python.org/)** - a general-purpose programming language that can be use within Grasshopper to gain more control over our programming logic, thereby extending Grasshopper's capabilities and allowing us to build custom tools

_Note: This class assumes a working knowledge of Rhino and basic familiarity with Grasshopper. No prior Python or programming experience is required._

| Final project                | 60% |

## Final project

### Brief

Using Rhino/Grasshopper/Python, create a design tool that solves a design problem and/or automates a design process.

The design problem can be in any domain and at any scale, from a piece of furniture, to a space within a building, to a building, to a city block. However, the design problem should be of a physical and geometric nature, and must be something you can effectively model using your group's Grasshopper/Python skills.

The final deliverable will be a Grasshopper (GHX) file which is labeled with expected inputs and outputs as well as a corresponding Rhino (3DM) file which stores any needed input geometry to test the tool. In addition to these files you will also prepare documentation of your project at various stages and submit a final report in the [class journal on Medium](https://medium.com/generative-design-course).

### Deliverables

#### 1. Pitch Review

- Prepare a slide presentation in any format to present your initial concept
  1. Quick pitch of your initial idea(s) for the product including MVP strategy:
  - Who is the user of the product (what is the market)?
  - What is the core value of the product (value proposition)?
  - What is the minimum I need to build to deliver this value (MVP)?
  2. Include relevant precedents (either your work or others) if possible to show similar work that‚Äôs been done and how your project will build on it.

#### 2. MVP (Midterm) Review

- Prepare a slide presentation in any format to present your MVP (Minimal Viable Product) proposal. Your proposal should contain at a minimum:
  1. A clear value proposition
  2. A description of the product with visual mockups
  3. Supporting research that justifies or supports the product‚Äôs value
  4. An initial prototyping plan to be discussed during feedback session

#### 3. Prototype (Final) Review

- Prepare a slide presentation in any format to present your MVP along with documentation of any prototypes that were built to prove-out the MVP concept.

#### 4. Final deliverable

- Final report published on Medium: https://medium.com/generative-design-course
  - Your report should present your tool, describe how it should be used, and show some example use-cases.
  - Your audience is an experienced Grasshopper user who needs to know what your tool is for and how they can integrate it into their workflows. This includes the expected inputs (including type and description) and the expected outputs the tool produces.
  - Follow the link above for a guide to writing up your report on Medium and submitting it to the class publication.
- Final documents submitted to Dropbox as a single ZIP file no later than Monday, December 18
  - Upload link: [SUBMIT]
  - Final video - This is an edited video that should show the entire story of your project, including a visual description of the problem you are trying to solve, the setup of the model, visualizations of the optimization process, and an analysis of the optimization results. The format of the video should be:
    1. between 0:30 and 1:00 long
    2. HD widescreen resolution 1920x1080
    3. .MP4 video format
  - 5-10 high-quality images for archiving.
    1. Raster images should be in .JPEG or .PNG format, at a high resolution (at least 3000 pixels on the shortest side)
    2. Vector images should be in .PDF or .AI format
  - Final versions of any **Grasshopper (GHX)**, **Rhino (3DM)** or other files needed to test your project

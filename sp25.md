## Introduction

In this course, we will explore applications of computer programming in design, focusing on how coding can be used to modify our design tools and create custom workflows that embed greater intelligence into our design processes.

Writing code, or "programming" is the oldest way of working with a computer, and was indeed the only way until the emergence of modern graphical user interfaces (GUI's) around the 1980's. While most people today interact with some kind of computer on a daily basis, GUI's allow them to interact with the software without even being aware of the code that actually tells the computer what to do. This way of interacting with computers makes software much easier to learn and work with, but also makes that software constrained to specific functionality that must be universal to all users. It also results in a lot of manual work from the user to get the software to do what they need it to do.

Writing our own code enables us to create our own tools that solve our specific needs, thereby embedding more intelligence into our process. As a side product such workflows tend to automate the most repetitive and routine design tasks so you can focus less on the technical work and more on the creative part of design. While computer software is now integrated into almost every design practice, actually writing computer code or creating custom software is not a typical skill set for a designer. While learning this new skill can be daunting, even learning a little bit will allow you to start customizing your tools and save you time.

The good news is we don't have to start from scratch, and you don't necessarily need to be able to build your own CAD software like Revit or Rhino to start developing custom tools and workflows. Most CAD software today support developing custom features and extensions through plugins and scripting interfaces. This allows you to get started with just a few lines of code, and expand the capabilities of your tools as your knowledge of coding grows.

This course is structured around several hands-on exercises that will demonstrate a variety of computational approaches and strategies for solving design problems through code. The class will focus on building real applications, while covering enough theory and case studies to ground the work we will be doing and expose some of the larger possibilities.

## Tech stack

The class will use several tools:

- **[Rhino3d](https://www.rhino3d.com/)** - great all-purpose 3d modeling software with great support for developing custom extensions through code
- **[Grasshopper](https://www.grasshopper3d.com/)** - Rhino's visual programming environment which gives us programmatic access to Rhino's geometry library and allows us to create automations by linking together visual building blocks representing different geometric commands
- **[Python](https://www.python.org/)** - a general-purpose programming language that can be use within Grasshopper to gain more control over our programming logic, thereby extending Grasshopper's capabilities and allowing us to build custom tools

_Note: This class assumes a working knowledge of Rhino and basic familiarity with Grasshopper. No prior Python or programming experience is required._

## Final project

### Brief

Using Rhino/Grasshopper/Python, create a design tool that solves a design problem and/or automates a design process.

The design problem can be in any domain and at any scale, from a piece of furniture, to a space within a building, to a building, to a city block. However, the design problem should be of a physical and geometric nature, and must be something you can effectively model using your group's Grasshopper/Python skills.

The final deliverable will be a Grasshopper (GHX) file which is labeled with expected inputs and outputs as well as a corresponding Rhino (3DM) file which stores any needed input geometry to test the tool. In addition to these files you will also prepare documentation of your project at various stages and submit a final report in the [class journal on Medium](https://medium.com/generative-design-course).
